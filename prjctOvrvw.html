      featured the NAU Rocket Club and NAU's Dr. Carson Pete as the team's primary clients and stakeholders. More
      information about both Dr. Carson Pete and the NAU Rocket Club can be found below.</p>
    <p class="text_column">The team was tasked to create a rocket payload capable of performing various actions
      based on received RF inputs sent by NASA for the 2023 NASA Student Launch competition. This payload needed to be
      able to apply various filters to a camera system which was normal to the direction of gravity and was capable of
      rotating 360 degrees. Specific NASA Payload requirements are listed below.</p>
    <p class="text_column">On an academic basis, this project was conducted in order to further prepare the team
      members for industry standards regarding engineering and design. On a scientific basis, this project was done to
      replicate the necessary processes NASA interplanetary probes are tasked with completing upon landing on an
      interstellar body. </p>

      <!--Intro Text-->
      <p class="twoColTxt">As outlined within the 2022-2023 NASA Student Launch Competition Handbook, the Rocket
        Payload must be capable of performing various tasks. These tasks are outlined below.</p>

      <!--General Payload Requirements-->
      <h4 class="twoColSubHead">General Requirements</h4>
      <p class="twoColItemList">The Payload will be capable of remaining in launch-ready configuration on the pad for a
        <u>minimum</u> of 2 hours without losing the functionality of any critical on-board components, although the
        capability to withstand longer delays is highly encouraged.</p>
      <p class="twoColItemList">Any structural protuberance on the rocket will be located aft of the burnout center of
        gravity. Camera housings will be exempted, provided the team can show that the housing(s) causes minimal
        aerodynamic effect on the rocket’s stability.</p>
      <p class="twoColItemList">The payload shall be fully retained until the intended point of deployment (if
        applicable), all retention mechanisms shall function as designed, and the retention mechanism
        shall not sustain damage requiring repair</p>
      <p class="twoColItemList">Teams who successfully complete a Vehicle Demonstration Flight but fail to qualify the
        payload by satisfactorily completing the Payload Demonstration Flight requirement will not be permitted to fly
        a final competition launch.</p>
      <p class="twoColItemList">Teams who complete a Payload Demonstration Flight which is not fully successful may
        petition the NASA RSO for permission to fly the payload at launch week. Permission will not be granted
        if the RSO or the Review Panel have any safety concerns.</p>

      <!--Recovery Requirements-->
      <h4 class="twoColSubHead">Recovery Requirements</h4>
      <p class="twoColItemList">The payload electrical circuits will be completely independent of any recovery system,
        GPS and altimeters electrical circuits.</p>
      <p class="twoColItemList">Any payload component which lands untethered to the launch vehicle will contain an
        active electronic GPS tracking device.</p>
      <p class="twoColItemList">All payload designs shall be approved by NASA. NASA reserves the authority to require a
        team to modify or change a payload, as deemed necessary by the Review Panel, even after a proposal has been
        awarded.</p>
      <p class="twoColItemList">Teams shall design a payload capable upon landing of autonomously receiving RF commands
        and performing a series of tasks with an on-board camera system. The method(s)/design(s) utilized to complete
        the payload mission shall be at the team’s discretion and shall be permitted so long as the designs are deemed
        safe, obey FAA and legal requirements, and adhere to the intent of the challenge.</p>
      <p class="twoColItemList">The payload shall not be jettisoned.</p>

      <!--Left-->
      <h4 class="twoColSubHeadAlt">Radio Frequency Command (RAFCO) Requirements</h4>
      <p class="twoColItemList">Launch Vehicle shall contain an automated camera system capable of swiveling 360º to
        take images of the entire surrounding area of the launch vehicle.</p>
      <p class="twoColItemList">The camera shall have the capability of rotating about the z axis. The z axis is
        perpendicular to the ground plane with the sky oriented up and the planetary surface oriented down.</p>
      <p class="twoColItemList">The camera shall have a FOV of at least 100º and a maximum FOV of 180º.</p>
      <p class="twoColItemList">The camera shall time stamp each photo taken. The time stamp shall be visible on all
        photos submitted to NASA in the PLAR.</p>
      <p class="twoColItemList">The camera system shall execute the string of transmitted commands quickly, with a
        maximum of 30 seconds between photos taken.</p>
      <p class="twoColItemList">NASA Student Launch Management Team shall transmit a RF sequence that shall contain a
        radio call sign followed by a sequence of tasks to be completed.</p>
      <p class="twoColItemList">The NASA Student Launch Management Panel shall transmit the RAFCO using APRS.</p>
      <p class="twoColItemList">NASA will use dedicated frequencies to transmit the message. NASA will operate
        on the 2-Meter amateur radio band between the frequencies of 144.90 MHz and 145.10 MHz. No team shall be
        permitted to transmit on any frequency in this range. The specific frequency used will be shared with teams
        during Launch Week. NASA reserves the right to modify the transmission frequency as deemed necessary.</p>
      <p class="twoColItemList"> The sequence of time-stamped photos taken need not be transmitted back to ground
        station and shall be presented in the correct order in your PLAR.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="footer_column">
      <!--Right-->
      <p class="twoColItemList">The list of potential commands
        to be given on launch day along with their radio transcriptions which shall be sent in a RF message
        using APRS transmission in no particular order are:</p>
      <p class="twoColItemSubList">A1—Turn camera 60º to the right.</p>
      <p class="twoColItemSubList">B2—Turn camera 60º to the left.</p>
      <p class="twoColItemSubList">C3—Take picture.</p>
      <p class="twoColItemSubList">D4—Change camera mode from color to grayscale.</p>
      <p class="twoColItemSubList">E5—Change camera mode back from grayscale to color.</p>
      <p class="twoColItemSubList">F6—Rotate image 180º (upside down).</p>
      <p class="twoColItemSubList">G7—Special effects filter (Apply any filter or image distortion you want and
        state what filter or distortion was used).</p>
      <p class="twoColItemSubList">H8—Remove all filters.</p>
      <p class="twoColItemList">An example transmission sequence could look something like, “XX4XXX C3 A1 D4 C3 F6 C3
        F6 B2 B2 C3.” Note the call sign that NASA will use shall be distributed to teams at a later time.</p>
      <p class="twoColItemList">The NASA Management Team shall transmit the RAFCO every 2 minutes</p>
      <p class="twoColItemList">The payload system shall not initiate and begin accepting RAFCO until AFTER the launch
        vehicle has landed on the planetary surface.</p>
