    <!---Preliminary Design Review Capstone Content--->
    <article class="footer_column">
      <p class="twoColTxt">As dictated by NASA, the NAU Rocket Club and the Capstone Team were required to contribute to
        the creation of the Student Launch Proposal document, which was delivered to NASA on September 10th, 2022.
        The Capstone Team, who were in charge of designing the rocket's payload systems, had to provide an initial
        outline of what kind of design they were likely to continue to develop. This design outline can be seen
        below:</p>

      <h4 class="twoColSubHead">Rough Design Outline</h4>
      <img src="images/dsgnmthd/conceptsel/miscimgs/Rough-Payload-Design.png" alt="" class=""/>


      <!--PDR Capstone Team Contributions-->
      <p class="twoColItemList">These figures outlined how the design would utilize some form of self-correcting
      mechanism to ensure that the payload and/or the camera would be able to rotate normal to the ground, as outlined
        within NASA's PayLoad Requirements (see the Project Overview page).</p>
      <p class="twoColItemList">These figures did not go into any specific detail regarding how the
        design is supposed to work, as these areas would be covered while the Capstone team conducted their Concept
        Generation and Selection.</p>
      <p class="twoColItemList">Due to the scheduled dates for various NASA Student Launch deliverables, the Capstone
      Team's contributions to this document became the team's first step in the design process. This deliverable was
      due about a week after the Capstone Team had officially been formed. </p>

      <h4 class="twoColSubHead">Concept Generation Overview</h4>
      <p class="twoColItemList">The team generated 14 concept variants (CVs) in order to generate a set of
        potential methods for overcoming the various challenges that the payload system would be required to
        complete. These designs are available within the gallery (right) along with a brief description of what
        the proposed designs were intended to do.</p>
      <p class="twoColItemList">The team wanted a healthy mix of passive and active methods in which these
      designs would utilize in order to rotate the camera system normal to the ground plane. As such, a handful
      of unorthodox methods were also included within these designs in order to allow the team's mechanical
      engineers to become aware of alternate methods of vertical alignment.</p>
      <p class="twoColItemList">How these CVs were evaluated and narrowed down into the team's final design
      can be viewed within the "Concept Evaluation" section (below).</p>

        <p class="">This designs utilizes a set of cylindrical legs to rotate itself normal to the ground. It
        then uses a scaffolding design to elevate the camera upwards and above any obstacles present on the
        local terrain.</p>

        <p class="">This design utilizes a set of latches composes of 3 equal sections of the rocket's nosecone
        to right itself upward regardless of how it has landed on the ground. The camera system is subsequently
        above any potential obstacles present on the local terrain.</p>

        <H2>CV05</H2>
        <p class="">This design utilizes a set of 3 to 4 legs to push itself off of the ground should the
          payload have landed on its side. The Center of Mass is below the legs, ensuring that the camera system
          is above any obstacles on the local terrain. The legs are operated by use of linear actuators.</p>

        <H2>CV06</H2>
        <p class="">This design utilizes a custom screw system that allows the payload to easily break away
          from the attached parachute. The subsystem then utilizes a set of 3-4 legs powered by linear
          actuators to orientate itself normal to the ground. The Center of Mass is below the legs, ensuring
          that the camera is positioned correctly.</p>

      </div>

        <H2>CV07</H2>
        <p class="">(Code Name: Spidertron 9000) This design focuses heavily on robotics, utilizing a set of legs composed from 3-4 equal
          sections of the rocket's nosecone that rotate 180 degrees from their initial positions. This method is
          completed through the use of a twisting mechanism, ensuring that the camera ends up at the top of
          the robot.</p>

        <H2>CV08</H2>
        <p class="">This design utilizes a set of 3 to 4 balloons to rotate itself normal to the ground plane.
          The Center of Mass is located towards the bottom of the payload, ensuring that the camera ends up in
          the correct location. The design uses a locking mechanism to push out 3 to 4 rectangular platforms
          to provide stability as the balloons are deflated.</p>

        <H2>CV09</H2>
        <p class="">This design utilizes a single balloon to raise the tip of the rocket nosecone above the ground.
        Importantly, the balloon does not need to carry the weight of the entire payload system. The Center of Mass
        will be positioned close to the bottom of the payload system such that the balloon only needs to act as a
        moment arm to completely align the payload normal to the ground plane.</p>

        <H2>CV10</H2>
        <p class="">This design utilizes a set of thrusters to forcefully push the payload systems normal to the
        ground plane. This design performed the worst out of all other Concept Variants as this design would have
        ignited explosive gasses to accomplish this goal.</p>

        <H2>CV11</H2>
        <p class="">This design relies solely on pasive alignment to ensure that the camera is normal to the ground
        plane. This design utilizes basic physics associated with achieving equilibrium, wherein the Center of
        Mass is as close to the ground as possible. This results in the spherical system to rotate and come
        to rest normal to the ground plane.</p>

        <H2>CV12</H2>
        <p class="">This design was inspired based on a 1988 NASA/University Advanced Design Program. The design
        incorporates a proposed lunar bulk material transport vehicle's method of proper alignment and applies this
        proposed design onto a deployable platform which can be removed from the payload transport tube through
        rotating a custom screw such that the platform is pushed out into the local environment.</p>

        <H2>CV13</H2>
        <p class="">This design utilizes a spring in place of a linear actuator to deploy a set of 3 to 4 legs out from
        the payload system, allowing for the device to be passively rotated normal to the ground plane.</p>

        <H2>CV14</H2>
        <p class="">This design utilizes a set of ball bearings to allow the camera system to passively rotate itself
        normal to the ground plane. The camera systems and platform are designed in such a way that this platform is,
        a a gimbal mechanism.</p>
