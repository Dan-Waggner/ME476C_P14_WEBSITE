    <!---Preliminary Design Review Capstone Content--->
    <article class="footer_column">
      <p class="twoColTxt">As dictated by NASA, the NAU Rocket Club and The Capstone Team was required to contribute to
        the creation of the Student Launch Proposal document, which was delivered to NASA on September 10th, 2022.
        The Capstone Team, who was in charge of designing the rocket's payload systems, had to provide an initial
        outline of what kind of design they were likely to continue to develop. This design outline can be seen
        below:</p>

      <!--General Payload Requirements-->
      <h4 class="twoColSubHead">Rough Design Outline</h4>
      <img src="images/dsgnmthd/Rough-Payload-Design.png" alt="" class=""/>


      <p class="twoColItemList">These figures outlined how the design will utilize some form of self-correcting
      mechanism to ensure that the payload and/or the camera would be able to rotate normal to the ground, as outlined
        within NASA's PayLoad requirements (see the Project Overview page).</p>
      <p class="twoColItemList">These figures did not go into any specific detail regarding how the
        design is supposed to work, as these areas would be covered while the Capstone team conducted their Concept
        Generation and Selection.</p>
      <p class="twoColItemList">Due to the scheduled dates for various NASA Student Launch deliverables, the Capstone
      Team's contributions to this document became the team's first step in the design process. This deliverable was
      due about a week after the Capstone Team had officially been formed. </p>
