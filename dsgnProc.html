    <article class="footer_column">
      <p class="twoColTxt">As dictated by NASA, the NAU Rocket Club and the Capstone Team were required to contribute to
        the creation of the Student Launch Proposal document, which was delivered to NASA on September 10th, 2022.
        The Capstone Team, who were in charge of designing the rocket's payload systems, had to provide an initial
        outline of what kind of design they were likely to continue to develop. This design outline can be seen
        below:</p>

      <!--PDR Capstone Team Contributions-->
      <p class="twoColItemList">These figures outlined how the design would utilize some form of self-correcting
      mechanism to ensure that the payload and/or the camera would be able to rotate normal to the ground, as outlined
        within NASA's PayLoad Requirements (see the Project Overview page).</p>
      <p class="twoColItemList">These figures did not go into any specific detail regarding how the
        design is supposed to work, as these areas would be covered while the Capstone team conducted their Concept
        Generation and Selection.</p>
      <p class="twoColItemList">Due to the scheduled dates for various NASA Student Launch deliverables, the Capstone
      Team's contributions to this document became the team's first step in the design process. This deliverable was
      due about a week after the Capstone Team had officially been formed. </p>

      <p class="twoColItemList">The team generated 14 concept variants (CVs) in order to generate a set of
        potential methods for overcoming the various challenges that the payload system would be required to
        complete. These designs are available within the gallery (right) along with a brief description of what
        the proposed designs were intended to do.</p>
      <p class="twoColItemList">The team wanted a healthy mix of passive and active methods in which these
      designs would utilize in order to rotate the camera system normal to the ground plane. As such, a handful
      of unorthodox methods were also included within these designs in order to allow the team's mechanical
      engineers to become aware of alternate methods of vertical alignment.</p>
      <p class="twoColItemList">How these CVs were evaluated and narrowed down into the team's final design
      can be viewed within the "Concept Evaluation" section (below).</p>

          The Center of Mass is located towards the bottom of the payload, ensuring that the camera ends up in

        Importantly, the balloon does not need to carry the weight of the entire payload system. The Center of Mass
        will be positioned close to the bottom of the payload system such that the balloon only needs to act as a

        As requested by Dr. Carson Pete, the team performed an Analytical Hierarchy Process
        (AHP) in order to determine what the final design should be. This selection process was utilized due to its
        allowance of direct comparison of each criterion to develop a weighted eigenvector which would later be
        applied to the concept variants' scoring, allowing for the creation of a numerical assessment on how well each
        concept variant meets these criteria.
      </p>

        To make this process easier to follow along with, each step has been numbered in order of completion.

        delivery vehicle. These criteria would later be ranked relative to one another. </p>

        Per the method of the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), the aforementioned criteria were next ranked relative

        question are equally significant with every value being a factor in which the criterion is more important.
        For instance, a weight of 9 meant that the team felt that the given criterion was 9 times as significant as the
        criterion it was being compared with, while a score of 1/3 meant that the team felt that the criterion in
        question was a third as significant as the criterion it was being compared with.

      <p class="twoColItemList">
        The previously generated Concept Variants (shown under Concept Selection) were next ranked based on how well
        they met the previously generated design criteria. The "Chute Detachment" criteria was a point of heavy
        discussion, and was subsequently considered a "grey area." The team ranked each concept variant on a
        case-by-case basis, ensuring to assess 1. how many cutes the concept variant would need to detach from, 2. how
        easily the concept variant would be able to detach from these chutes, and 3. how difficult it would be to
        include a method of parachute detachment.
      </p>
      <p class="twoColItemList">
        The team's final rankings for each Concept Variant is listed below.

        As is required with the Analytical Hierarchy process, The aforementioned concept variant rankings were then
        normalized. The normalized rankings of these concept variants were required in order to properly compare them
        with the principle Eigen vector, which was generated in Step 3. Finally, the principle Eigen vector was then
        multiplied into each concept variant's normalized scores to generate a final assessment of how well each
        concept variant would meet the team's engineering requirements.

      <p class="twoColItemList">
        The finalized scores for the concept variants are depicted below. The Preference Rank is on a scale of 1 to
        14, with 1 being the first place position for the concept variant's preference score, and 14 being the last
        place position. The top 6 designs are highlighted in the below image, with credit being given to the
        individual(s) that came up with the design.

        As determined from the Analytical Hierarchy Process, CV14 was deemed to most adequately meet the required
        design parameters. As described within the above image gallery, this Concept Variant uses a set of ball
        bearings to allow the camera system to passively rotate itself normal to the ground plane. The camera system
        and platform are designed in such a way that this platform acts as a gimbal.

      <p class="twoColItemList">
        The rough CAD model for Concept Variant 14 is depicted to the right. Shown is the proposed method for chute
        detachment, which utilizes a motor to rotate a threaded rod, allowing for the payload system to be ejected
        from the rocket body. This system will also include two pairs of ball bearings such that the camera is able
        to gimbal with 360 degrees of movement.

        In order to gain experience in assembling the proposed payload design and in order to ensure that the
        payload design would work as expected, the team generated a prototype of the payload. This prototype's
        purpose was to identify any unexpected hurtles that would need to be overcome, both in regard to the
        payload's operation and in regard to the overall assembly process.
      </p>
      <p class="twoColItemList">
        The team learned that it may be extremely difficult to apply adhesive material onto the outsides of the ball
        bearings in many areas. This issue can be rectified through installing the ball bearings as press fits into
        their respective positions. Interestingly, the deployment system worked exactly as expected, allowing for
        a reliable method of chute detachment.
