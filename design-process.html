      <p class="twoColTxt">As dictated by NASA, the NAU Rocket Club and the Capstone Team were required to contribute to
        the creation of the Student Launch Proposal document, which was delivered to NASA on September 10th, 2022.
        The Capstone Team, who were in charge of designing the rocket's payload systems, had to provide an initial
        outline of what kind of design they were likely to continue to develop. This design outline can be seen
        below:</p>

      <img src="images/dsgnmthd/miscimgs/Rough-Payload-Design.png" alt="" class=""/>

      <!--SLP Capstone Team Contributions-->
      <p class="twoColItemList">These figures outlined how the design would utilize some form of self-correcting
      mechanism to ensure that the payload and/or the camera would be able to rotate normal to the ground, as outlined
        within NASA's PayLoad Requirements (see the Project Overview page).</p>
      <p class="twoColItemList">These figures did not go into any specific detail regarding how the
        design is supposed to work, as these areas would be covered while the Capstone team conducted their Concept
        Generation and Selection.</p>
      <p class="twoColItemList">Due to the scheduled dates for various NASA Student Launch deliverables, the Capstone
      Team's contributions to this document became the team's first step in the design process. This deliverable was
      due about a week after the Capstone Team had officially been formed. </p>

      <p class="twoColItemList">The team generated 14 concept variants (CVs) in order to generate a set of
        potential methods for overcoming the various challenges that the payload system would be required to
        complete. These designs are available within the gallery (right) along with a brief description of what
        the proposed designs were intended to do.</p>
      <p class="twoColItemList">The team wanted a healthy mix of passive and active methods in which these
      designs would utilize in order to rotate the camera system normal to the ground plane. As such, a handful
      of unorthodox methods were also included within these designs in order to allow the team's mechanical
      engineers to become aware of alternate methods of vertical alignment.</p>

      concept variant meets these criteria.

    <p>
      Per the method of the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), the aforementioned criteria were next ranked relative
      to one another. These criteria were ranked on a scale of 1/9 to 9, where 1 means that the two criteria in
      question are equally significant with every value being a factor in which the criterion is more important.
      For instance, a weight of 9 meant that the team felt that the given criterion was 9 times as significant as the
      criterion it was being compared with, while a score of 1/3 meant that the team felt that the criterion in
      question was a third as significant as the criterion it was being compared with.

        As determined from the Analytical Hierarchy Process, CV14 was deemed to most adequately meet the required
        design parameters. As described within the above image gallery, this Concept Variant uses a set of ball
        bearings to allow the camera system to passively rotate itself normal to the ground plane. The camera system
        and platform are designed in such a way that this platform acts as a gimbal.

        to gimbal with 360 degrees of movement.

        The team would eventually design 3 different prototypes. The first prototype was designed around late
        November / early December 2022. This prototype focused heavily on the overall passive orientation systems
        that the team had in mind. The second prototype was generated as a midway step while constructing the final
        design. This prototype allowed the team to ensure that 1. all critical gimballing components were properly
        aligned and 2. that the selected design passed very basic sanity checks. The final prototype that the team
        generated served to ensure that the design process foe the deployment bay was sound, and that the bay was
        compatible with the required electronics needed to be employed by the Electrical Division. More information
        regarding the team's prototyping methods are outlined in the Final Design section of this website.

        feasibility of using a passive orientation system to align the electronics properly with respect to the
        Earth's gravitational vector. Due to errors within the design process on the side of the Electrical Division,
        the final design would be modified extensively to allow for the inclusion of a 6-inch antenna. The team took
        great pride in this prototype, as it was the first prototype that they had come up with.

        The team's payload systems went under numerous various hardware, software, and electrical subsystem testing
        variations in order to ensure that all systems were operating both as intended and with reliable repetition.
        These tests were broken up into 2 categories: structural testing and electrical testing. The Structural
        testing focused on ensuring that the payload was able to support the entire weight of the rocket (more on
        that below), while the Electrical testing focused on ensuring that all critical sensors were operating
        correctly. The Electrical tests saw the design of 2 experimental apparatuses that each tested a specific sensor.

        connection between these two critical systems.

        Multiple test flights were conducted using a "skeleton" of the payload systems. This "skeleton" solely
        consisted of the primary payload supports and the NEMA 17 Stepper Motor. All other critical systems
        were not included, as the team was concerned that, if something went wrong and this support system failed
        during descent, the Electrical Division's components would become irreparably damaged. The Mechanical
        Division's components were, aside from the NEMA 17, relatively easy and cost-efficient to replace, while the
        Electrical Division's components were extremely expensive.

        launched by comparing the payload’s current height to its initial height. Upon exceeding a height of 1,000 ft

        These tests were conducted using NAU's physics department's vacuum chamber, depicted above. The deployment bay
        was placed inside the vacuum chamber, wherein the pressure was reduced for between 5 and 7 second, ensuring
        that the pressure changed enough to simulate an altitude change of at least 5,000 ft. The altimeter functions
        by measuring the local pressure around itself and computing that directly into altitude readouts. By using a
        vacuum chamber, the team was able to reliably create a controlled system wherein the altimeter could be
        evaluated under identical conditions as if it were in flight. The sensor's code was modified and revised to
        ensure that the system was both correctly reading the relative altitudes and that, upon reaching this height
        and upon returning to its initial height within 75 feet, the motor driver would be initialized.

        inches. Back-handed calculations informed the Mechanical Division that the sensors should be reading between
        24- and 39- times Earth's acceleration. These calculations were compared with the accelerometer's readouts,
        and the sensor was modified to ensure that it was correctly displaying its measured acceleration. Once this

        After months and months of designing, testing, and iterating, the team had finalized their design just in
        time for the Alabama NASA Student launch competition.
      </p>
      <p class="">
        The team's design utilizes both passive and active orientation capabilities to ensure that the Electrical
        Components of the challenge system are able to adequately receive and act upon various
        transmissions delivered by NASA. The system uses a passive quadruple-bearing gimbal system to passively rotate
        the electronics normal to Earth's gravitational vector. This system also has a protective cover that spins
        down first to ensure that the electronics are not damaged by debris. The system then employs an active
        motor to elevate a camera platform such that both the camera and the antenna are above the
        local surface, ensuring reliable surveillance and transmission capabilities. The design also includes a
        Rotating Thread-Rod Deployment System (RTRDS) to completely separate from the transport vehicle during
        deployment. The RTDS uses a NEMA 17 Stepper Motor to push the payload out of the rocker body tube, preventing
        the systems from being damaged as a result of the rocket's parachutes pulling the system to various areas.
