      <h3>About Us</h3>
      <p>As part of Northern Arizona University's (NAU's) Engineering Program, Mechanical Engineers Dawson Pursell,
        Zachary Leib-Perry, Corbin Strycker, and Daniel Waggner, in conjunction with Electrical Engineers Timothy
        Singleton, Jarrard Mountain, and Lane Dempsey have been given the opportunity to work alongside NAU's Rocket
        Club to design a payload system for the 2022/2023 NASA Student Launch Competition.</p>
      <p>More information about these awesome people is depicted below. To learn more about the NASA Student Launch
        Competition, check out the Project Overview section. To see these Engineers' Design Process, check out the
        Design Process page. To see their finalized payload design, check out the Final Design page. And, of course,
        to see how well the NAU Rocket Club did within the competition, check out the Competition page.</p>

      <p>
        Hi! My name is Corbin, and I was the Logistics and partial Financial Manager for the NASA Student Launch
        Competition. I have always wanted to follow the steps to design a rocket, which made this the perfect
        project!

      <p>
        Hi, I'm Dan! Throughout this project, I was our Mechanical Engineering team's CAD engineer. I was also our
        team's website dev! Ever since I was a kid I've always been fascinated with Rocket Science. This project was a
        blast!

      <p>
        My name is Tim Singleton. I originally attended college for my paramedicâ€™s degree, but changed professions at
        26 to study electrical engineering. Since changing fields, I have thoroughly enjoyed learning as much as I can
        about designing circuits and how these circuits are implemented into a final product. Overall, I greatly enjoyed
        working on this project.

      <p>
        Greetings! My name is Jarrard Mountain, and I was the Radio Frequency System Manager that controlled the rocket
        payload's onboard camera systems. I am extremely grateful to have had the opportunity to work alongside both
        NAU's Rocket Club and the Mechanical Engineering Rocket Payload Design Team.

      <h4>Lane Dempsey</h4>
		<h5>Electrical Engineer</h5>
      <p>
        Hello, my name is Lane Dempsey! For the 2022/23 NASA Student Launch competition, I was part of the electronics
        and radio systems engineering design team. What made me pursue this NASA project for my Capstone
        project were the opportunities to explore new areas of electrical engineering and mechanical engineering,
        allowing me to obtain a set of multidisciplinary skills for my future in engineering.
