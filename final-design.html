        This prototype served to demonstrate the feasibility of a mechanical gimbal and the proposed
        method of deployment. The assembly process was also subsequently reevaluated in order to completely remove the
        usage of adhesives, as adhesive materials caused the ball bearings to be misaligned, resulting in the gimbal
        having issues rotating with the dummy weight used.
      </p>
      <p class="twoColItemList">
        Future iterations were likely to see the outer gimbal platform being composed of metal (likely aluminum), with
        the ball bearings being press-fitted into the platform and into the gimbal base caps. This would have removed
        any possibility of misalignment caused by the use of adhesives. Additionally, the various wooden dowels shown
        would have been replaced with 0.25" metal rods (also aluminum), which could be purchased from various online
        vendors at a reasonable price. Preliminary research suggested that 2x 1l long 0.25" diameter
        Aluminum Rods could be purchased for as little as $3 USD before shipping. These rods would also likely be
        press-fitted into their respective slots. While the final design would eventually be modified, this prototype
        ultimately allowed the team to confirm the viability of using a passive method for rotating the camera
        system normal to Earth's gravitational vector.
      </p>
      <p class="twoColItemList">
        Due to errors within the design process on the side of the Electrical Division, the final design would be
        modified extensively to allow for the inclusion of a 6-inch antenna. These changes are present within
        Prototype II, outlined below.

        The second prototype (right) contained most of the finalized gimbal systems and used placeholder wooden
        rods to keep the system together. Later revisions of the design saw the M2 screws that would have been used to
        hold the aluminum variants of the wooden supports being replaced with two threaded rods. This was due to the
        Mechanical Division becoming extremely uneasy about the expected shear stresses acting onto those tiny screws
        under maximum rocket acceleration (~21 G's).

        The above image depicts the second prototype for the Payload's mechanical gimbal. This prototype served to
        allow the Mechanical Engineering division to begin assembling the mechanical systems to determine aspects that
        required redesigns and miscellaneous revisions.

        The third prototype (right) was generated while the team was designing the payload's deployment system. This
        system would house the NEMA 17 Stepper Motor, which would be deploying the payload system out of the rocket
        body tube, effectively seperating the payload from the rocket's parachutes completely, avoiding damages
        caused by the rocket being dragged around by the primary parachute. This prototype allowed the team to ensure
        that the design generated on paper made practical and logical sense in reality. This prototype was used to
        fit the NEMA 17 and her associated sensors, power systems, motor drivers, and onboard computers (namely a
        Raspberry Pi. These components would be attached to the acrylic electrical platforms, which are the clear
        panels shown in the image to the right.
      </p>

      <p class="twoColItemList">
        This prototype used 3D-printed end plates as a placeholder for the aluminum bulkheads that would eventually
        be used to encase the system. The 3D-printed standoffs would not be replaced due to their structures being
        supported by custom-built quarter-inch screws, which were hand-crafted from 1/4" 20 all-threads and
        corresponding nuts. Importantly, the acrylic platforms allowed for increased internal space for various
        components, and it allowed for the Electrical Division to be able to easily troubleshoot their electronics.
        These transparent platforms would prove extremely useful while running design tests leading up to the
        rocket's final launch in Alabama.

        The above image depicts the prototype of the payload's deployment bay. This design would not see many changes
        following the prototype's debut; however, the endplates would be replaced with Aluminum bulkheads to protect
        the electronics from black-powder charges, which would be responsible for the main parachute's deployment.
