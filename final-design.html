        This prototype served to demonstrate the feasibility of a mechanical gimbal and the proposed
        method of deployment. The assembly process was also subsequently reevaluated in order to completely remove the
        usage of adhesives, as adhesive materials caused the ball bearings to be misaligned, resulting in the gimbal
        having issues rotating with the dummy weight used.
      </p>
      <p class="twoColItemList">
        Future iterations were likely to see the outer gimbal platform being composed of metal (likely aluminum), with
        the ball bearings being press-fitted into the platform and into the gimbal base caps. This would have removed
        any possibility of misalignment caused by the use of adhesives. Additionally, the various wooden dowels shown
        would have been replaced with 0.25" metal rods (also aluminum), which could be purchased from various online
        vendors at a reasonable price. Preliminary research suggested that 2x 1l long 0.25" diameter
        Aluminum Rods could be purchased for as little as $3 USD before shipping. These rods would also likely be
        press-fitted into their respective slots. While the final design would eventually be modified, this prototype
        ultimately allowed the team to confirm the viability of using a passive method for rotating the camera
        system normal to Earth's gravitational vector.
      </p>
      <p class="twoColItemList">
        Due to errors within the design process on the side of the Electrical Division, the final design would be
        modified extensively to allow for the inclusion of a 6-inch antenna. These changes are present within
        Prototype II, outlined below.

        The second prototype (right) contained most of the finalized gimbal systems and used placeholder wooden
        rods to keep the system together. Later revisions of the design saw the M2 screws that would have been used to
        hold the aluminum variants of the wooden supports being replaced with two threaded rods. This was due to the
        Mechanical Division becoming extremely uneasy about the expected shear stresses acting onto those tiny screws
        under maximum rocket acceleration (~21 G's).

        The third prototype (right) was generated while the team was designing the payload's deployment system. This
        system would house the NEMA 17 Stepper Motor, which would be deploying the payload system out of the rocket
        body tube, effectively seperating the payload from the rocket's parachutes completely, avoiding damages
        caused by the rocket being dragged around by the primary parachute. This prototype allowed the team to ensure
        that the design generated on paper made practical and logical sense in reality. This prototype was used to
        fit the NEMA 17 and her associated sensors, power systems, motor drivers, and onboard computers (namely a
        Raspberry Pi) These components would be attached to the acrylic electrical platforms, which are the clear
        panels shown in the image to the right.

      <p class="twoColItemList">
        This prototype used 3D-printed end plates as a placeholder for the aluminum bulkheads that would eventually
        be used to encase the system. The 3D-printed standoffs would not be replaced due to their structures being
        supported by custom-built quarter-inch screws, which were hand-crafted from 1/4" 20 all-threads and
        corresponding nuts. Importantly, the acrylic platforms allowed for increased internal space for various
        components, and it allowed for the Electrical Division to be able to easily troubleshoot their electronics.
        These transparent platforms would prove extremely useful while running design tests leading up to the
        rocket's final launch in Alabama.

        The team's design utilizes both passive and active orientation capabilities to ensure that the Electrical
        Components of the challenge system are able to adequately receive and act upon various
        transmissions delivered by NASA. The system uses a passive quadruple-bearing gimbal system to passively rotate
        the electronics normal to Earth's gravitational vector. This system also has a protective cover that spins
        down first to ensure that the electronics are not damaged by debris. The system then employs an active
        motor to elevate a camera platform such that both the camera and the antenna are above the
        local surface, ensuring reliable surveillance and transmission capabilities. The design also includes a
        Rotating Thread-Rod Deployment System (RTRDS) to completely separate from the transport vehicle during
        deployment. The RTDS uses a NEMA 17 Stepper Motor to push the payload out of the rocker body tube, preventing
        the systems from being damaged as a result of the rocket's parachutes pulling the system to various areas.

        This is the design's Mechanical Bill of Materials. The Mechanical Division's budget was $2,000 and, as shown,
        they came nowhere close to exceeding it. Due to the fact that, officially, NAU does not recognize this project
        as an interdisciplinary capstone, the expenses generated by the Electrical Division are not included here.
